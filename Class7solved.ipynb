In theory, you could always use the `readlines()` function, and then use the data parsing tools we learned in the previous module to format the data as you needed. But sometimes there are other ways that make more sense, particularly if the data is (1) all or mostly one type of data (for example, all numbers) and/or (2) formatted in a table. Frequently, a table will be mostly numbers, but have column or row labels.\n",

If you have data in a spreadsheet program that you need to import into a python code, you can save the data as a csvfile to read it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a CSV file that contains data from a molecular dynamics trajectory. We have a 20 ns simulation that used a 2 fs timestep. The data was saved to the trajectory file every 1000 steps, so our file has 10,000 timesteps. At each timestep, we are interested in the distance between particular atoms. These trajectories were generated with the AMBER molecular dynamics program and the distances were measured with the python program MDAnalysis. The table of atomic distances was saved as a CSV file called “distance_data_headers.csv”. This file was downloaded as part of your lesson materials. Open the file in a text editor and study it to determine its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In analyzing tabular data, we often need to perform the same types of calculations (averaging, calculating the minimum or maximum of the data set), so we are once again going to use a python library, this time a library that contains lots of functions to perform math operations. This library is called `numpy`. The `numpy` library has several functions available to read in tabular data. One of these functions is the `genfromtxt()` function. We will use the `help()` function to learn more about `genfromtxt()` and how it works."

This seems like a job for a `for` loop, but unlike last time, we don’t want to count over a particular list and do something for every item, we want to do something a particular number of times. Basically, we want to take that 1 and let it be every number, up to the number of columns. This is a task for the `range()` function. The general syntax is\n",

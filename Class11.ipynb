Or perhaps you’ve worked on a group project where multiple people were making changes to files and you ended up with multiple versions of multiple files and it was very confusing? Now imagine that you are working on a software project with 5, 10 or even 100 people. Every person would need their own copies of all the code, but it would be very hard to keep up with the changes each person was making and merge them all together. All of these issues can be handled by using *version control* on your project.\n",

    "Now open a terminal window and navigate to the location where you want the repository to be stored on your local computer.\n",

    "## Setting git remotes\n",
    "Now that you have all the copies of the repository in place, you need to make connections between the copies so you can transfer information. These connections between the copies are called *remotes*. We already discussed remotes a bit above, when we pushed our code to GitHub.\n",

We need to create a new remote called `upstream` that connects the repository on our local computer to the main repository on GitHub. You can actually name any remote anything you want, but `upstream` is the accepted name for the remote to the original main repository.\n",
    "\n",

    "git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now if you use `git remote -v` again to list your remotes, you should see two remotes, `origin` (to your copy on GitHub) and `upstream` (to the main repository on GitHub)."

    "## Information flow using GitHub\n",
    "The normal workflow when you are working on a collaborative project with `git` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pull changes to the main project from upstream.\n",
    "2. Work on the project on your local copy of the repository.\n",
    "3. Commit your changes to your local copy.\n",
    "4. Push your changes to your copy of the repository on GitHub.\n",
    "5. Submit your changes to the main developers through a *pull request* so they can consider including them in the main repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting changes from the main repository\n",
    "To get changes from the main repository into your local repository, you use the `upstream` remote and use the `pull` command.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull upstream master\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you enter this command, several things can happen, depending on what changes have been added to the main repository. If the new changes don’t conflict with what you have already, then you might see something that says `Fast Forward`. If there are conflicts, you will have a merge conflict that you need to resolve, where you select which version of the file you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull vs. fetch and merge\n",
    "The `pull` command is actually a combination of two other `git` commands, `fetch` and then `merge`. The `pull` command is easier because it is just one step, but in complex situations you might want to do a `fetch` so you can see what changes have been made and then decide to `merge` or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using branches to make changes\n",
    "Within a repository, you can actually create different copies of your code. These are called *branches*. This is particularly useful if you want to work on a new feature, but you want to keep another copy of the code that is working in case you mess something up. In all of the examples above, we have been using the `main` or `master` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make a branch and make some changes to the classmate’s code you forked and cloned. First, make sure you are on your `master` branch.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, make a new branch for your edits. You can name your branch anything you want, but we will call it `edits` in this example. Usually you would choose a more informative name, but this is just an example.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git branch edits\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we will switch from our `master` branch to the new `edits` branch.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout edits\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now that we have crated a branch to work on, we can make changes to the files without worrying about messing up anyone else’s work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "Open the `README.md` file and make a change to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `git status` to check which files have been modified on this branch. Then use `git add` and `git commit` to commit the changes to the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can push your changes through the `origin` remote to *your* repository on GitHub.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push origin edits\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create a new branch on your GitHub repository called `edits` and push your changes to that branch. Generally, you can not push your changes upstream into the main repository on GitHub. This is why you need your own fork on GitHub; you can always push to something that belongs to you, but not something that belongs to someone else."

    "## Being a Collaborator\n",
    "There are ways that you can push upstream to the main repository. The owner of a repository can add you as a collaborator and give you permission to push changes. For small projects with only a few people, this is fairly common. For large projects with 100’s of developers, no one does this, and you must submit your changes through a *pull request* as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in this flow of information, if you want to pull new changes from the main repository into your repository on GitHub, there is no remote that directly connects those two. To accomplish this, you would do a `pull` from the main repository to the copy on your local computer through the `upstream` remote and then do a `push` from your local copy to your copy on GitHub through the `origin` remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting your changes to the main developers\n",
    "Once you have pushed changes to your repository on GitHub, you may want to tell the main developers about your changes and ask them to consider merging them into the main repository. This is called making a *pull request*. Essentially, you are suggesting to the developers that they pull changes from your repository into their repository. To make a pull request, navigate to the GitHub page of the class and click on **Pull Request** in the navigation bar across the top. On the next page, click the green button that says **New Pull Request**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the next page, in the left box that says `base`, the main repository should be listed. If it is not, use the dropdown menu to select it. In the right box that says `compare`, use the dropdown menu to select the `edits` branch of your repository. If you don’t see it in the list, then you need to click the blue link above the boxes that says *compare across forks*. Click **Create Pull Request**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the next page, you will type a message to the developers telling them what changes you have made. You can also suggest reviewers who you want to check out your changes. When you are finished, click **Create Pull Request**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The developers will receive a notification of your pull request and then they can review your changes and decide if they are going to merge them into the main repository. You will receive a notification letting you know if/when the pull request has been merged."
